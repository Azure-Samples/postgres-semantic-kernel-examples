## Postgres & .NET Semantic Kernel Examples

### Setup

To set up the project, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands in the `dotnet` directory:

```sh
cd dotnet
copy appsettings.example.json appsettings.json
# Update appsettings.json with your PostgreSQL and Azure OpenAI settings

dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

### Configuration

Before running the examples, you need to configure your database and Azure OpenAI settings. Use the `appsettings.example.json` file in the `dotnet` directory as a template to create an `appsettings.json` file with the proper settings for your database. Update the connection details for your PostgreSQL database and Azure OpenAI instance in the `appsettings.json` file.

This project will work with any PostgreSQL instance that has pgvector installed.

### Using Azure DB for PostgreSQL

This project includes connection logic to use Azure DB for PostgreSQL with Entra authentication. If `EntraAuthentication` is set to true in the `Postgres` section of the `appsettings.json, Entra Authentication is used with DefaultAzureCredentials. You'll need to be logged into the Azure CLI to correctly authenticate with your Entra credentials.

### Vector Store Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

The `Vector Store RAG` example demonstrates how to search the arXiv API for specific papers based on a topic and category, embed the abstracts using Azure OpenAI's embedding service, and store these embeddings in a PostgreSQL vector store for efficient searching. It includes commands for loading data, searching data, and querying the model.

#### Running the Example

To run the example, navigate to the `dotnet` directory and execute the following commands:

##### Load Data

```sh
dotnet run --project PGSKExamples.csproj load --topic RAG --total 100
```

This will load the data from arXiv papers based on the specified topic and category. The `category` parameter should be one of the arXiv categories, which you can find [here](https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy). The abstracts of the papers are then embedded using Azure OpenAI's embedding service, and these embeddings are stored in a PostgreSQL vector store for efficient searching.

##### Query Data

```sh
dotnet run --project PGSKExamples.csproj query "Your query here"
```

This will search the loaded arXiv papers based on the provided query by comparing the query embedding against the stored embeddings in the PostgreSQL vector store.

Example output, loaded ~600 RAG-related papers:

```sh
> dotnet run query "What are good chunking strategies to use for unstructured text in RAG applications?"
```

Output:

Here's a list of strategies and insights about chunking for unstructured text, derived from recent research articles:

### Recommended Chunking Strategies for RAG Applications

1. **Recursive Character Splitting** -
   The Recursive Character Splitter is shown to outperform Token-based Splitters in preserving contextual integrity during document splitting. This method is particularly effective for maintaining the coherence and capturing the meaning essential for retrieval tasks. [Paper: [Exploring Information Retrieval Landscapes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08479v2)]

2. **Node-based Extraction** -
   For documents with highly diverse structures, employing node-based extraction with LLM-powered Optical Character Recognition (OCR) improves chunking by creating context-aware relationships between text components (e.g., headers and sections). This is crucial for multimodal documents like presentations and scanned files. [Paper: [Advanced ingestion process powered by LLM parsing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15262v1)]

3. **Inference-time Hybrid Structuring** -
   Structured reconstruction of documents is advocated to handle knowledge-intensive tasks better. This involves optimizing the document format for task-specific structuring using "StructRAG" frameworks, which determine the optimal chunk size and type for retrieving relevant information accurately. [Paper: [StructRAG: Boosting Knowledge Intensive Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08815v2)]

4. **Interpretable Knowledge Segmentation** -
   Chunking HTML or unstructured text into meaningful units for specific downstream tasks can be enhanced by pre-trained models combined with algorithms for efficient segmentation. This improves HTML or table data understanding and retrieval from unstructured text. [Paper: [Leveraging Large Language Models for Web Scraping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08246v1)]

5. **Benchmark-Driven Optimization** -
   Use domain-specific benchmarks (e.g., UDA Suite) to evaluate and optimize chunking and retrieval methods. Real-world applications, involving lengthy or noisy documents in diverse formats, benefit from such approaches to balance character and word-level chunking boundaries. [Paper: [UDA: A Benchmark Suite for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15187v2)]

### Practical Suggestions:

- **Context Preservation with Overlap**: Introducing a degree of overlap between adjacent chunks ensures preserved meaning and continuity.

- **Multimodal Parsing**: Different parsing strategies for highly unstructured data types improve the granularity of retrieval strategies (i.e., PDFs, presentations).

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Incorporating advanced evaluation techniques like SequenceMatcher, BLEU, METEOR, and BERT Score can guide chunking methodology tailoring for retrieval accuracy.
